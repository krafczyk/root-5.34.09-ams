 ROOT is a software framework for data analysis, a powerful tool to cope 
 with the demanding tasks typical of state of the art scientific data 
 analysis. 
 Among its prominent features are an advanced graphical user interface, 
 ideal for interactive analysis, an interpreter for the C++ programming 
 language, for rapid and efficient prototyping and a persistency mechanism 
 for C++ objects, used also to write every year petabytes of data recorded 
 by the Large Hadron Collider experiments.
 This introductory guide illustrates the main features of ROOT, relevant for 
 the typical problems of data analysis: input and plotting of data from 
 measurements and fitting of analytical functions.
