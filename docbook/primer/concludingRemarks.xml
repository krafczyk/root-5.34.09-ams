<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<para>
This is the end of our guided tour for beginners through ROOT. 
There is still a lot coming to mind to be said, but by now you 
are experienced enough to use the ROOT documentation, most importantly 
the <emphasis role="bold"><link xlink:href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT home page</link></emphasis> and the
<emphasis role="bold"><link xlink:href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reference-guide">
ROOT reference guide</link></emphasis> with the documentation of all ROOT classes, 
or the <emphasis role="bold"><link xlink:href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/users-guide">
ROOT users guide</link></emphasis>.

<para>
A very useful way for you to continue exploring ROOT is to study
the examples in the sub-directory <code>tutorials/</code> of any
ROOT installation.

There are some powerful features of ROOT which were not treated in this 
document, e.g. packages named RooFit and RooStats providing an advanced 
framework for model building, fitting and statistical analysis. 
The ROOT class <code>TMVA</code>   offers multi-variate analysis tools 
including an artificial neural network and many other advanced tools 
for classification problems. 
The remarkable ability of ROOT to handle large data volumes was 
already mentioned in this guide, implemented through the 
class <code>TTree</code>. But there is still much more for you to explore!
